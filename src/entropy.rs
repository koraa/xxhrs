/// not been formally verified as message authentication codes; they also do
/// not guarantee that the entire secret is used, the secret is impractically
/// large (tens to hundreds of bytes) and pathological secrets are not handled
/// well at all.
///
/// However, these functions are harder to revers than using seeds, in fact
/// the seeded variant internally just uses a modified secret.
///
/// This is why xxhrs provides support for these, but renames the secrets "EntropyPool"
/// to make it clear that it is not really a proper keyed hash.
///
/// You can generate a random EntropyPool or use the key derivation
/// function provided by the c library. You could also fill the secret manually,
/// for instance using HMAC-SHA256 or Kekkac, but this is probably overkill.
