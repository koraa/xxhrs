# xxhrs

Bindings to the xxhash C library. Covers the old xxhash functions as well as
the new xxh3 hash function.

## Use cases?

This was written mainly so xxh3 can be evaluated for use in rust. If you just
need an xxhash implementation, you can use [twox](https://crates.io/crates/twox-hash),
if you want a fast hash function to use in hash tables you probably want [ahash](https://crates.io/crates/ahash).

Currently xxh3 is still experimental and it's output can change, however
as soon as it's implementation has stabilized, it's hash output will remain
consistent across processes & computers.

After that has happened, possible use cases for this crate are:

* You specifically need a xxh3 implementation
* You need high performance and one shot hashing is OK (you probably want xxh3_64)
* You need high performance and you are hashing particularly long inputs (thousands of KB, again xxh3_64 is what you want)
* You need a 128 bit hash function

Note that if you are using xxhrs for performance, you should probably create benchmarks.

## Usage

Cargo.toml

```toml
[dependencies]
# Random entropy is enabled by default; it enables RandomState*
# and EntropyPool::randomize()
xxhrs = { version = "1.0.2", features = ["random_entriopy"] }
```

```rust
use std::{collections::HashMap, hash::Hasher};
use xxhrs::{
  RandomStateXXH64, RandomStateXXH3_64, XXH32, XXH64,
  XXH3_64, XXH3_128, EntropyPool
};

// Old XXHash 64 bit version
let mut h = HashMap::<i32, &str, RandomStateXXH64>::default();
h.insert(42, "the answer");
assert_eq!(h.get(&42), Some(&"the answer"));

// XXH3 64 bit version
let mut h = HashMap::<i32, &str, RandomStateXXH64>::default();
h.insert(42, "the answer");
assert_eq!(h.get(&42), Some(&"the answer"));

// XXHash 32 bit without seed, one shot hashing
assert_eq!(XXH32::hash(b"MyData"), 1695511942);

// XXHash 64 bit with seed, one shot hashing
assert_eq!(XXH64::hash_with_seed(1234, b"MyData"), 4228889600861627182);

// XXH3 64 bit version, streaming hashing, with seed
let mut h = XXH3_64::with_seed(1234);
h.write(b"MyFirstData");
h.write(b"MySecondData");
assert_eq!(h.finish(), 8235025456677196530);

// XXH3 128 bit version, straming hashing, with custom key
let entropy = EntropyPool::with_key(b"My Custom Key!"); // Can be reused for extra performance!
let mut h = XXH3_128::with_entropy(&entropy);
h.write(b"MyFirstData");
h.write(b"MySecondData");
assert_eq!(h.finish(), 49549903637678458428443811344187957401);
```
